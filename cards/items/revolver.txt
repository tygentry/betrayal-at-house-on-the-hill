"An old, potent-looking weapon."

You can use the revolver to attack with Speed instead of Might. (Your opponent then defends with Speed and takes physical damage.)
Roll 1 additional die on your Speed attack roll (maximum of 8 dice).
With the Revolver, you can attack anyone in the same room or within line of sight. If you attack someone in another room and lose, you don't take damage.
You can't use another weapon while using this one.
