Once during your turn after the haunt is revealed, you can attempt a Sanity roll to use the Bell:
5+ Move any number of unimpeded heroes 1 space closer to you.
0-4 The traitor can move any number of monsters 1 space closer to you. (If you are the traitor, this result has no effect.) If there is no traitor, all monsters move 1 space closer to you.
