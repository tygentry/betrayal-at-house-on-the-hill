"A hand-crafted antique. It plays a haunting melody that gets stuck in your head."

Once per turn, you can open or close the Music Box.
While the Music Box is open, any explorer or monster with a Sanity trait that enters or starts its turn in the same room must make a Sanity roll of 4+. If the roll fails, the explorer or onster ends its turn as it's mesmerized by the music.
If an explorer or monster carrying the Music Box is mesmerized, it drops the Music Box. If the Music Box is open when it is dropped, it remains open.
