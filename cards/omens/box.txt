When you draw this card, draw an item card and put it on this card. That item cannot be dropped or traded. If someone would steal that iten, you can instead discard the Box. On your turn, you may remove that item from the Box and put a different item in your possession into the Box. If it is empty, you may put an item in the Box. The Box cannot be stolen.
