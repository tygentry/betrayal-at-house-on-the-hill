"A board with letters and numbers to call the dead."

Before you movev during your turn, you can look at the top tile of the room stack.
If you use the Spirit Board after the haunt has been revealed, the traitor can move any number of monsters 1 space closer to you. (If you are the traitor, you don't have to move these monsters.) If there is no traitor, all monsters move 1 space closer to you.
