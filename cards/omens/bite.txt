"A growl, the scent of death. Pain. Darkness. Gone."

When you draw this card, *something* bites you. The player on your right rolls a Might 4 attack against you for the mysterious *something* (before it runs away into the darkness). You defend against this attack as normal, by rolling dice equal to your Might.
This omen can't be dropped, traded, or stolen.
